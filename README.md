interactive visualizations: d3, plotly

This repository demonstrates the use of JavaScript to create interactive visualizations. The code fetches JSON data asynchronously, populates a dropdown with IDs, and updates charts and metadata based on the selected ID. D3.js was utilized for data fetching and manipulation, and Plotly.js was used for chart rendering.
